| [`flake.nix`](./flake.nix) | inputs and configuration outputs |

## Codex skills

Keep provider files unchanged when refreshing a skill. Local integrations are limited to `imoocs`, `proxmox-pve`, `line-delivery`, and the personal `subagent-model-router` policy. The existing denix module and Home Manager deployment remain unchanged.
