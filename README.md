## Hosts

| Host | Platform | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `surface` | x86_64 Linux | laptop |
| `nvidia-desktop` | x86_64 Linux | desktop |
| `macbook` | aarch64 Darwin | laptop |
| `web-server` | x86_64 Linux | personal sites |
| `adguard-home` | x86_64 Linux | DNS filter VM config |
| `nas` | x86_64 Linux | storage VM config |
| `wsl` | x86_64 Linux | NixOS-WSL |

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`flake.nix`](./flake.nix) | inputs and configuration outputs |
| [`hosts`](./hosts) | host identity, platform, hardware imports |
| [`modules`](./modules) | denix-discovered system/Home Manager modules; feature directories contain their Nix definitions (normally `default.nix`), `files/`, and `tests/` |
| [`rices`](./rices) | theme and desktop variants, including wallpapers |
| [`packages`](./packages) | custom packages, runtime builders, package-owned sources, and their tests |
| [`.agents/skills`](./.agents/skills) | Provider-original Codex skills and local integrations, deployed by Home Manager |
| [`secrets`](./secrets) | sops-nix encrypted secrets |

## Codex skills

Keep provider files unchanged when refreshing a skill. Local integrations are limited to `imoocs`, `proxmox-pve`, `line-delivery`, `project-context-init`, and the personal `subagent-model-router` policy. The existing denix module and Home Manager deployment remain unchanged.

| Skills | Provider |
| --- | --- |
| Tax and document-reading skills (24) | [kazukinagata/shinkoku](https://github.com/kazukinagata/shinkoku) |
| Engineering and productivity skills (25) | [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) |
| `frontend-design` | [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) |
| `find-skills` | [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) |

`hatch-pet` uses the v2 skill bundled in ChatGPT.app through `~/.agents/skills/hatch-pet`; it is not copied into this repository. Pi extension-owned skills are linked from their editable extension directories rather than duplicated. Skill security checks use the upstream [Cisco AI Defense scanner](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner) CLI (`skill-scanner`).

## Pi

[`modules/pi-coding-agent`](./modules/pi-coding-agent) manages the global Pi settings, model overrides, local extensions, and theme. Extensions remain editable under [`modules/pi-coding-agent/files/extensions`](./modules/pi-coding-agent/files/extensions) and are linked into `~/.pi/agent/extensions`; their `node_modules` stay local and Git-ignored. Credentials, trust decisions, sessions, missions, caches, and generated model catalogs remain local under `~/.pi/agent`.
