## 17. Process

- **Prototype interactively — an interactive demo is worth "a million static designs."** You discover the interface by building and playing with it; a working prototype also sets a concrete bar that prevents a mediocre final implementation.
- **Design interaction and visuals together.** "You shouldn't be able to tell where one ends and the other begins." Motion is not a layer added after the pixels.
- **Test with real people in real context**, and review motion with fresh eyes — play it in slow motion / frame-by-frame to catch what's invisible at full speed.

## Quick Reference

| Need | Technique | Concrete value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default UI spring | Critically damped, no overshoot | `damping 1.0`, `response 0.3–0.4` |
| Momentum / flick spring | Under-damped, slight bounce | `damping ~0.8`, `response 0.3–0.4` |
| Gesture → spring velocity | Hand off release velocity | `gestureVelocity / (target − current)` if normalized |
| Flick landing point | Project momentum | `current + (v/1000)·d/(1−d)`, `d ≈ 0.998` |
| Interrupt cleanly | Start from presentation (live) value | read the on-screen transform |
| Avoid reversal "brick wall" | Carry velocity through re-target | spring that blends velocity |
| Reversible transition | Mirror the easing curve | inverse cubic-bézier |
| Decide reverse vs. commit | Use velocity **sign**, not position | at release |
| 1:1 drag | Pointer Events + capture | respect the grab offset |
| Feedback | On pointer-down, continuous | never only at the end |
| Boundary | Rubber-band, don't hard-stop | progressive resistance |
| Translucent chrome | `backdrop-filter` layer | content scrolls under |
| Type tracking | Size-specific, never fixed | tighten large text (`-0.02em`), body near `0` |
| Reduced motion | Cross-fade, not slide/spring | `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` |
